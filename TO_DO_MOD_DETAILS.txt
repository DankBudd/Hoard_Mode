//ABILITY IDEAS:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- A new ultimate for Vengeful Spirit (This can be literally anything you think would be fun/useful in Horde Mode)

-- Invoker forge spirit melting strike hits creeps

-- Razor Static link is AOE and effects creeps

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful

-- Venomancer Scourge Wards have a limit (like pugna ward fpr example) instead of just a death timer
