Next Update Patch Notes:

1.18
PATCH PARITY 6.88!
Tons of wave changes for 4/5 player maps!

// 1st Wave
-- Roshan boss now spawns at 6:40 instead of 8:20 (same as 2 player map)
-- Bottom lane now shares the same lane configuration as other lanes
-- Now consists of Gnolls, Berserkers, and Wild Beasts (other units moved to later waves)

// 2nd Wave (Mechs, Spiders, or Zombies)
-- Small Skeletons now spawn only during the zombie wave
-- Spider wave no longer spawns extra spiderlings
-- Ogre Boss spawns at 13:20 instead of 14:20 (same as 2 player map)

// 3rd Wave (Bears, Harpies, or Ogres)
-- Now has a third option: Ogres and Satyrs

// 4th Wave (Treants or Wolves)
-- Starts spawning at 15:00 instead of 17:00, reducing three minute gap after wave three to one minute, same as other wave gaps
-- Still ends at 20:00 (increasing duration of wave to five minutes)

// 5th Wave (Ghosts or Golems)
-- Ghost boss spawns 10 seconds earlier (matches golem spawn)

// 6th Wave (Kobolds or Centaurs)
-- Added Rippers to Kobold wave

// 7th Wave (Dragons or Demons)
-- Demons dogs now spawn during this wave, instead of as soon as it ends
-- Small birds added to dragon wave, buffed to match

// 8th Wave (Roshans)
-- Ancient Apparition spawns 30 seconds earlier to coincide with wave spawn, will spawn a second one two minutes later (so be careful and hunt him!)


/////// Secondary importance:
-- Fix Giant Mech particles not working
-- meepo clones not sharing stats at all without scepter

To Do:
-- update russian lang
-- Lifestealer hotkeys getting messed up
-- make horde mode video
-- More map bosses than drop super items you can't buy in shop
-- Old stumpy is not affected by lithe boots, but is affected by deolator minus armour


BIG JOBS TO DO:

1. Players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn and attack towards the dire ancient. (Hero Line Wars uses a creep spawning thing similar)


//ITEM IDEAS:

-- linkens 2 with soul ring + damage item

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITY IDEAS:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- A new ultimate for Vengeful Spirit (This can be literally anything you think would be fun/useful in Horde Mode)

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- Invoker forge spirit melting strike hits creeps

-- Razor Static link is AOE and effects creeps

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful

-- Venomancer Scourge Wards have a limit (like pugna ward fpr example) instead of just a death timer
