Next Update Patch Notes:

1.20
Gold and XP changes!
XP is now granted fully to all allies within a 1300 radius, instead of divided amongst them.
Assist gold is now granted for slain creeps, granting 50% of last hit gold to all heroes within a 1300 radius.
These changes should make the 5 Player Map less difficult than the 4 Player Map. This also means that players are less penalized for grouping up or defending at the tower.

Splitter Wave:
Giant Golem boss no longer splits, now has full array of Tiny powers
Giant Golem boss carries an Aghanim's Scepter and Vladmir's Cuirass
Reduced Giant Golem boss hit points from 30000 to 20000
Replaced ancient golems with Earthshakers
Reduced split spawn size from 3 to 2
Reduced large splitter hp from 7000 to 1000
Added Craggy Exterior to Large Splitters
Reduced medium splitter hp from 4000 to 750
Reduced small splitter hp from 750 to 500

Ghost Wave:
Reduced attack range of ghosts from 930 to 700
Reduced Ghost Boss hp from 30000 to 20000

Final Wave:
Skeleton King's Doom should now be properly blocked by Linken's Sphere

To Do:
-- update russian lang
-- Lifestealer hotkeys getting messed up
-- make horde mode video
-- More map bosses than drop super items you can't buy in shop
-- Old stumpy is not affected by lithe boots, but is affected by desolator minus armour


BIG JOBS TO DO:

1. Players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn and attack towards the dire ancient. (Hero Line Wars uses a creep spawning thing similar)


//ITEM IDEAS:

-- linkens 2 with soul ring + damage item

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITY IDEAS:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- A new ultimate for Vengeful Spirit (This can be literally anything you think would be fun/useful in Horde Mode)

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- Invoker forge spirit melting strike hits creeps

-- Razor Static link is AOE and effects creeps

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful

-- Venomancer Scourge Wards have a limit (like pugna ward fpr example) instead of just a death timer
