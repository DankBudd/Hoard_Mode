Next Update Patch Notes:

1.24k
Difficulty overhaul
-Enemy HP scales based on the number of players/heroes (whichever is higher) at 0:00
-Formula: 1 + 0.2 * (players - 2); [1p: 80% HP, 2p: 100% HP, 3p: 120% HP, etc.]
-Additionally, boss HP scales based on difficulty
-Formula: 1 + 0.1 * difficulty [Easy: 100%, Medium: 110%, Hard: 120%, Ultra: 130%]
-Difficulty aura actually works now, moved to friendly ancient, integrated offense and armor bonuses
-Formula: +15% enemy outgoing damage and -10% enemy incoming damage per each difficulty level above Easy [up to +45%/-30% on Ultra]
-At player counts above 1 and difficulties above Easy regular enemies have a chance to spawn with one of 3 new auras: Frenzy, Blight, or Corruption [the chance increases with player count and difficulty]
-Boss HP adjusted to reflect difficulty changes
-Overall challenge will increase at higher player counts, while solo players should have more options (a significant number of games played are 1p games, according to statistics). 4p map should be unnecessary now.
