Next Update Patch Notes:

1.20u
-- Mega Towers now have a 25% chance to perform a special bash that ignores evasion: it deals 1% of the target's hp per hit as magic damage in an area (also affecting the target)
-- Fixed Lich boss particle effects
-- Spooki Meme boss now has an inventory! His base stats have been reduced to compensate, but he is more difficult. Good luck!
-- Added simple inventories (mostly base damage and attack speed and movement speed items) to other bosses

To Do:
-- update russian lang
-- Lifestealer hotkeys getting messed up
-- make horde mode video
-- More map bosses than drop super items you can't buy in shop


BIG JOBS TO DO:

1. Players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn and attack towards the dire ancient. (Hero Line Wars uses a creep spawning thing similar)


//ITEM IDEAS:

-- linkens 2 with soul ring + damage item

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITY IDEAS:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful
