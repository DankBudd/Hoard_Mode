Next Update Patch Notes:

1.21
Patch 7.00 Parity! Part one?
All heroes have their default talents (some don't work though!)

Units:
-- Spooki heartstopper aura reduced in strength

Items:
-- Fixed Boots of Intellect debuff aura

Heroes:
// Brewmaster
-- Drunken Haze reverted to vanilla

// Drow Ranger
-- Reverted size of Wave of Silence to vanilla (talent upgrades it)

// Jakiro
-- Ice Path reverted to vanilla

// Morphling
-- Replicate reverted to vanilla

// Necrophos
-- Sadist changed to new version

// Shadow Shaman
-- Serpent Wards reverted to vanilla

// Spirit Breaker
-- Charge of Darkness reverted to vanilla

// Visage
-- Gravekeeper's Cloak reverted to vanilla
-- Familiars reverted to vanilla (still with reduced cooldown)

To Do:
-- update russian lang
-- Lifestealer hotkeys getting messed up
-- make horde mode video
-- More map bosses than drop super items you can't buy in shop


BIG JOBS TO DO:

1. Players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn and attack towards the dire ancient. (Hero Line Wars uses a creep spawning thing similar)


//ITEM IDEAS:

-- linkens 2 with soul ring + damage item

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITY IDEAS:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful
