Next Update Patch Notes:

1.21
Patch 7.00 Parity! Part one?
All heroes still have their default talents (some don't work though!)
The map still has some issues (runes don't spawn, etc)
Monkey King is not enabled, because two of his abilities don't work against creeps (the passive and the ult)

Units:
-- Spooki Doom cooldown increased to 30, manacost increased to 300

Items:
-- Quelling Blade still uses % damage bonus

Heroes:
// Brewmaster
-- Drunken Haze reverted to vanilla

// Drow Ranger
-- Reverted size of Wave of Silence to vanilla (talent upgrades it)

// Jakiro
-- Ice Path reverted to vanilla

// Morphling
-- Replicate reverted to vanilla

// Necrophos
-- Sadist changed to new version

// Shadow Shaman
-- Serpent Wards reverted to vanilla

// Spirit Breaker
-- Charge of Darkness reverted to vanilla

// Visage
-- Gravekeeper's Cloak reverted to vanilla
-- Familiars reverted to vanilla (still with reduced cooldown)

To Do:
-- update russian lang
-- Lifestealer hotkeys getting messed up
-- make horde mode video
-- More map bosses than drop super items you can't buy in shop


BIG JOBS TO DO:

1. Players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn and attack towards the dire ancient. (Hero Line Wars uses a creep spawning thing similar)


//ITEM IDEAS:

-- linkens 2 with soul ring + damage item

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITY IDEAS:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful
