Next Update Patch Notes:

1.19d
Difficulty is now declared upon match start.

HEROES:
Dazzle
-- Fixed tooltip on Contagious Flamboyance (it stopped being global several patches ago)

Terrorblade
-- Removed self cast from Sunder (it did nothing, but still put it on cooldown)

Viper
-- Removed split shot from Poison Attack
-- Poison Attack now applies the poison in an aoe splash
-- Poison Attack also applies damage from Nethertoxin to affected targets
-- Nethertoxin now deals full damage to all units

/////// Secondary importance:
-- Fix Giant Mech particles not working
-- meepo clones not sharing stats at all without scepter

To Do:
-- update russian lang
-- Lifestealer hotkeys getting messed up
-- make horde mode video
-- More map bosses than drop super items you can't buy in shop
-- Old stumpy is not affected by lithe boots, but is affected by desolator minus armour


BIG JOBS TO DO:

1. Players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn and attack towards the dire ancient. (Hero Line Wars uses a creep spawning thing similar)


//ITEM IDEAS:

-- linkens 2 with soul ring + damage item

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITY IDEAS:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- A new ultimate for Vengeful Spirit (This can be literally anything you think would be fun/useful in Horde Mode)

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- Invoker forge spirit melting strike hits creeps

-- Razor Static link is AOE and effects creeps

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful

-- Venomancer Scourge Wards have a limit (like pugna ward fpr example) instead of just a death timer
