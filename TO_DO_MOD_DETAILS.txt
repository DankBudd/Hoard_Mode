-- Lifestealer hotkeys getting messed up
-- make horde mode video
-- More map bosses than drop super items you can't buy in shop


BIG JOBS TO DO:

1. Players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn and attack towards the dire ancient. (Hero Line Wars uses a creep spawning thing similar)


//ITEM IDEAS:

-- linkens 2 with soul ring + damage item

//ABILITY IDEAS:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful
