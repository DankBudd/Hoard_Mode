Next Update Patch Notes:

1.19j
6.88c Update
Bloodseeker, Drow Ranger, Leshrac, Lina, Mirana, Oracle, Timbersaw and Visage have vanilla changes

Elder Titan
-- Echo Stomp damage unchanged

Faceless Void
-- Chronosphere cooldown reduced to 120/100/80

Shadow Demon
-- Disruption incoming damage increased from 100% to 150%

Treant Protector
-- Living Armor regeneration reverted to vanilla

Items:
Magic Wands and Sticks now gain charges no matter how many heroes are nearby
Gold bags (including those made by Bounty Hunter's Track) now grant 50 gold to each member of the team, no matter how many players are in game
Desolator 2 icon is fixed

To Do:
-- update russian lang
-- Lifestealer hotkeys getting messed up
-- make horde mode video
-- More map bosses than drop super items you can't buy in shop
-- Old stumpy is not affected by lithe boots, but is affected by desolator minus armour


BIG JOBS TO DO:

1. Players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn and attack towards the dire ancient. (Hero Line Wars uses a creep spawning thing similar)


//ITEM IDEAS:

-- linkens 2 with soul ring + damage item

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITY IDEAS:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- A new ultimate for Vengeful Spirit (This can be literally anything you think would be fun/useful in Horde Mode)

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- Invoker forge spirit melting strike hits creeps

-- Razor Static link is AOE and effects creeps

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful

-- Venomancer Scourge Wards have a limit (like pugna ward fpr example) instead of just a death timer
