MOD STUFF TO DO:
-- Fix/reduce noise level of Shadow Shaman Shackles and storm spirit pull, possibly sniper ulti also
-- Zombie + skeltons at 40 mins
-- Radiance not working on ancient type mobs

Bigger Jobs:

1. Add way to buy upgrades like buying back buildings (towers in the base) through a purchasable item. 
(The towers in question are currently called "npc_dota_hoard_tower" on the 4p map and "npc_dota_hoard_tower_easy" on the 5p map.

2. The bot lane friendly creep spawn stops spawning when there is a certain number of units lingering around
(Important to stop lag issues from banking them too much - It would be nice if the friendly units could be upgraded by killing rax/purchasing upgrades)
 
3. npc_dota_creature_roshan needs to be a more viable objective:
-- Roshan drops rapiers? (I'll make rapiers no longer purchasable from the shop) 
-- Following the Roshan Theme, I'll make some big mobs that hang around in spots on the map, 
I'll need help getting them to drop stuff (again rapiers or whatever, I need to refine this idea)

5. Big Job: Different spawns for differnet maps (Currently both maps use the same spawners and spawn the same stuff. 
I don't know how to change what a spawner is spawning based on the map - 
I tried just using different spawners of either map. but that just breaks the LUA)

6. Instead of steady creep spawn top, players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn there and attack towards the dire ancient. 


KV STUFF:

//ITEMS:

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITES:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- Naga Ensnare is AOE (like earthbind)

-- Ursa fury swipes does increasing %hp based damage instead of a static damage increment

-- A rework of Dazzle's Poison Touch (Make it hit multiple targets or have aoe would be good)

-- Magnus Skewer effects creeps (I tried doing this myself, again should be easy but I failed)

-- A new ultimate for Vengeful Spirit (This can be literally anything you think would be fun/useful in Horde Mode)

-- Ogre Magi Fireblast and Unrefined Fireblast AOE or something like that

-- Beast Master Roar does AOE damage and Knockback 

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- PA Dagger does something cool, like fans out in front of her like whirling axes or something, idk.

-- Invoker forge spirit melting strike hits creeps

-- Razor Static link is AOE and effects creeps

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful

-- Venomancer Scourge Wards have a limit (like pugna ward fpr example) instead of just a death timer
