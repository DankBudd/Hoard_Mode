Next Update Patch Notes:

Alpha 2.3
General:
-- There is no longer a team selection screen before the game starts
-- Bot lane now spawns "Radiant Defenders" rather than standard creeps, 
these units have low attack damage but high resistance to damage. 
a squad of 3 will spawn every 70 seconds after 17 seconds into the game.
-- A couple of radiant defenders now spawn and hang around by the ancient ready to defend it 
(don't let those cute little fellas die)
-- Furthest Dire jungle camp now spawns "Toll Masters" which provide large gold bounties when farmed,
they will stack up in their camp as time goes on until the camp reaches maximum capacity at 20 minutes
-- Shrike HP increased by 300 and gold bounty increased greatly

Items:
-- Etheral Blade renamed "Ether Cannon" and now has a large AOE
-- Dagon Recipe cost reduced from 1000 to 600 gold
-- Bloodstone charges increased from 10 to 12

Heroes:
//Sniper:
-- Replaced assassinate with High Caliber: 
A togglable ability that allows sniper's attacks to hit all units in a radius around his 
primary target - costs mana
//Slardar:
-- Replaced sprint with Slither: Slardar gains bonus attack speed as well as movement speed,
there is no incoming damage penalty
-- Slithereen Crush damage rescaled from "100 250 400 550" to "200 300 400 500"
-- Slardar Bash chance reduced from "30 40 50 60" to "15 17 19 21" 
//Shadow Sharman:
-- Shackles now disable all units in an AOE around Shadow Sharman
-- Ether Shock mana cost increased from "95 105 135 160" to "100 135 165 200"
//Ember Spirit: 
-- Fire remnant max charges increased from 3 to 6
-- Fire remnant charge restore time decreased from 35 to 15 seconds

MOD STUFF TO DO:
-- Fix/reduce broken/too loud sounds for Shadow Shaman Shackles and storm spirit pull, possibly sniper ulti also
-- Zombie + skeltons at 40 mins
-- Radiance not working on ancient type mobs

Bigger Jobs:

1. Add way to buy upgrades like buying back buildings (towers in the base) through a purchasable item. 
(The towers in question are currently called "npc_dota_hoard_tower" on the 4p map and "npc_dota_hoard_tower_easy" on the 5p map.

2. The bot lane friendly creep spawn stops spawning when there is a certain number of units lingering around
(Important to stop lag issues from banking them too much - It would be nice if the friendly units could be upgraded by killing rax/purchasing upgrades)
 
3. npc_dota_creature_roshan needs to be a more viable objective:
-- Roshan drops rapiers? (I'll make rapiers no longer purchasable from the shop) 
-- Following the Roshan Theme, I'll make some big mobs that hang around in spots on the map, 
I'll need help getting them to drop stuff (again rapiers or whatever, I need to refine this idea)

4. Randomly detirmined spawns (Some of the spawners spawn a number of units randomly between two integers - 
would be nice to expand this to a few randomly detirmined mob types also) 

5. Big Job: Different spawns for differnet maps (Currently both maps use the same spawners and spawn the same stuff. 
I don't know how to change what a spawner is spawning based on the map - 
I tried just using different spawners of either map. but that just breaks the LUA)

6. Instead of steady creep spawn top, players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn there and attack towards the dire ancient. 


KV STUFF:

//ITEMS:

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITES:

-- Ursa fury swipes does increasing %hp based damage instead of a static damage increment

-- A rework of Dazzle's Poison Touch (Make it hit multiple targets or have aoe would be good)

-- Magnus Skewer effects creeps (I tried doing this myself, again should be easy but I failed)

-- A new ultimate for Vengeful Spirit (This can be literally anything you think would be fun/useful in Horde Mode)

-- Ogre Magi Fireblast and Unrefined Fireblast AOE or something like that

-- Beast Master Roar does AOE damage and Knockback 

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- PA Dagger does something cool, like fans out in front of her like whirling axes or something, idk.

-- Invoker forge spirit melting strike hits creeps

-- Razor Static link is AOE and effects creeps

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful

-- Venomancer Scourge Wards have a limit (like pugna ward fpr example) instead of just a death timer
