-- MOD STUFF TO DO

THE MISSION IS TO GET TO BETA

Scripting Goals:

1. Add way to buy upgrades like buying back buildings (towers in the base) through a purchasable item

2. The bot lane friendly creep spawn stops spawning when there is a certain number of units lingering around
(Important to stop lag issues from banking them too much - 
If I need to put another scipted spawner there which spawns radiant creeps instead of the default dota spawner
 let me know - If it becomes a scripted spawner though I assume destorying dire rax will no longer give you super creeps -
 I want to keep that feature in the game so that will need to be coded back in if it stops)
 
3. npc_dota_creature_roshan needs to be a more viable objective:
-- Roshan drops rapiers (I'll make rapiers no longer purchasable from the shop) 
-- Following the Roshan Theme, I'll make some big mobs that hang around in spots on the map, 
I'll need help getting them to drop stuff (again rapiers or whatever, I need to refine this idea)

4. Randomly detirmined spawns (Some of the spawners spawn a number of units randomly between two integers - 
would be nice to expand this to a few randomly detirmined mob types also) 

5. Big Job: Different spawns for differnet maps (Currently both maps use the same spawners and spawn the same stuff. 
I don't know how to change what a spawner is spawning based on the map - 
I tried just using different spawners of either map. but that just breaks the LUA)


Less Intersting:

//ITEMS:
	
-- Magic stick/wand give changes based on creep kills (each kill gives 1 charge,
 there are like 30 - 40 maybe more max charges, 
 but they give like 1 mana/health or probably less to be balanced)

--Urn gains charges from killing certain unit types 
(if there is a way to specify the units that are "ConsideredHero" "1" to give urn charges, 
although I think Urn currently gets charges based on a unit's baseclass rather than this function)
