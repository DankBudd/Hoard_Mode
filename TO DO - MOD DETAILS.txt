Next Update Patch Notes:

Alpha 2.3b
General:
-- Some mob spawns are now randomised in number
(creeps will spawn a certain number between two values, this is never more than a difference of 2)
-- Gnoll gold bounty increased greatly for the 5p_easy map (remains the same for the hard map)
-- Skeleton gold bounty increased for the 5p_easy map 
-- Radiant Defenders have an extra 200 hp and 1 hp regen on the 5p_easy map

Items:
-- Ether Cannon base damage increased from 100 to 500

Heroes:
//Sniper:
-- High Caliber manacost reduced to "35 25 15" and loud sound reduced a bit
-- Take aim bonus range decreased from "200 325 450 575" to "150 250 350 450"
//Legion Commander:
-- Overwhelming Odds base damage increased from "40 80 120 160" to "50 100 150 200"
-- Overwhelming Odds damage per creep hit increased from "14 16 18 20" to "15 22 28 35"
//Storm Spirit:
-- Ball Lightening initial mana percentage cost decreased from 7% to 3%
-- Ball Lightening mana cost percentage reduced from 0.7% to 0.1%
-- Ball Lightening damage per unit distance travelled increased from "8 12 16" to "10 15 20"

MOD STUFF TO DO:
-- give new easy units names
-- Fix shaman shackes sound
-- Zombie + skeltons at 40 mins
-- Radiance not working on ancient type mobs

Bigger Jobs:

1. Add way to buy upgrades like buying back buildings (towers in the base) through a purchasable item. 
(The towers in question are currently called "npc_dota_hoard_tower" on the 4p map and "npc_dota_hoard_tower_easy" on the 5p map.

2. The bot lane friendly creep spawn stops spawning when there is a certain number of units lingering around
(Important to stop lag issues from banking them too much - It would be nice if the friendly units could be upgraded by killing rax/purchasing upgrades)
 
3. npc_dota_creature_roshan needs to be a more viable objective:
-- Roshan drops rapiers? (I'll make rapiers no longer purchasable from the shop) 
-- Following the Roshan Theme, I'll make some big mobs that hang around in spots on the map, 
I'll need help getting them to drop stuff (again rapiers or whatever, I need to refine this idea)

4. Instead of steady creep spawn top, players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn there and attack towards the dire ancient. 


KV STUFF:

//ITEMS:

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITES:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- Naga Ensnare is AOE (like earthbind)

-- Ursa fury swipes does increasing %hp based damage instead of a static damage increment

-- A rework of Dazzle's Poison Touch (Make it hit multiple targets or have aoe would be good)

-- Magnus Skewer effects creeps (I tried doing this myself, again should be easy but I failed)

-- A new ultimate for Vengeful Spirit (This can be literally anything you think would be fun/useful in Horde Mode)

-- Ogre Magi Fireblast and Unrefined Fireblast AOE or something like that

-- Beast Master Roar does AOE damage and Knockback 

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- PA Dagger does something cool, like fans out in front of her like whirling axes or something, idk.

-- Invoker forge spirit melting strike hits creeps

-- Razor Static link is AOE and effects creeps

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful

-- Venomancer Scourge Wards have a limit (like pugna ward fpr example) instead of just a death timer
