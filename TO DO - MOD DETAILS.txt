MOD STUFF TO DO:
-- Add Some one time spawners in dire jungle for things that drop stuff or something
-- ADD Ssome sstatic friendly creep spawns in base to defend

Bigger Jobs:

1. Add way to buy upgrades like buying back buildings (towers in the base) through a purchasable item. 
(The towers in question are currently called "npc_dota_hoard_tower" on the 4p map and "npc_dota_hoard_tower_easy" on the 5p map.

2. The bot lane friendly creep spawn stops spawning when there is a certain number of units lingering around
(Important to stop lag issues from banking them too much - 
If I need to put another scipted spawner there which spawns radiant creeps instead of the default dota spawner
 let me know - If it becomes a scripted spawner though I assume destorying dire rax will no longer give you super creeps -
 I want to keep that feature in the game so that will need to be coded back in if it stops)
 
3. npc_dota_creature_roshan needs to be a more viable objective:
-- Roshan drops rapiers (I'll make rapiers no longer purchasable from the shop) 
-- Following the Roshan Theme, I'll make some big mobs that hang around in spots on the map, 
I'll need help getting them to drop stuff (again rapiers or whatever, I need to refine this idea)

4. Randomly detirmined spawns (Some of the spawners spawn a number of units randomly between two integers - 
would be nice to expand this to a few randomly detirmined mob types also) 

5. Big Job: Different spawns for differnet maps (Currently both maps use the same spawners and spawn the same stuff. 
I don't know how to change what a spawner is spawning based on the map - 
I tried just using different spawners of either map. but that just breaks the LUA)

6. Instead of steady creep spawn top, players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn there and attack towards the dire ancient. 


KV STUFF:

//ITEMS:
	
-- Etherial Blade has a large AOE

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITES:

-- An interesting rework of Sniper Assassinate (can just be a bit of aoe, but anything weird or intersting can work)

-- A rework of Dazzle's Poison Touch (Make it hit multiple targets or have aoe would be good)

-- Magnus Skewer effects creeps (I tried doing this myself, again should be easy but I failed)

-- Slardar Sprint gives bonus attack speed when activated 

-- A new ultimate for Vengeful Spirit (This can be literally anything you think would be fun/useful in Horde Mode)

-- A replacement of Shadow Sharman Shackles with something more AOE/anti-horde like

-- Ogre Magi Fireblast and Unrefined Fireblast AOE or something like that

-- Beast Master Roar does AOE damage and Knockback 

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- PA Dagger shoots through creeps dealing damage to all the creeps it passes through 

-- Invoker forge spirit melting strike hits creeps

-- Razor Static link is AOE and effects creeps

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful
