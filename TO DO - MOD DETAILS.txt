BIG JOBS TO DO BEFORE BETA:

1. Players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn and attack towards the dire ancient. (Hero Line Wars uses a creep spawning thing similar)

KV STUFF:

//ITEMS:

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITES:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- A new ultimate for Vengeful Spirit (This can be literally anything you think would be fun/useful in Horde Mode)

-- Ogre Magi Fireblast and Unrefined Fireblast AOE or something like that

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- Invoker forge spirit melting strike hits creeps

-- Razor Static link is AOE and effects creeps

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful

-- Venomancer Scourge Wards have a limit (like pugna ward fpr example) instead of just a death timer


Ideas:

-- yolo
 Map where one player plays with thE horde and can summon and control some units and has certain abilities, obviously the model would be a skeleton because meme
