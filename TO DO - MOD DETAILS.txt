"Has neither cars nor balls, 4/10" ~ Harold

BIG JOBS TO DO BEFORE BETA:

1. Get some mobs (Particularly roshan in question) to drop items (an item like a sacred relic or something, possibly an item otherwise not available in the shop)
This will allow me to make plenty of interesting objectives around the map, some extra mobs you can beat for item drops. 

2. Players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn and attack towards the dire ancient. (Hero Line Wars uses a creep spawning thing similar)


KV STUFF:

//ITEMS:

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITES:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- Ursa fury swipes does increasing %hp based damage instead of a static damage increment

-- A rework of Dazzle's Poison Touch (Make it hit multiple targets or have aoe would be good)

-- A new ultimate for Vengeful Spirit (This can be literally anything you think would be fun/useful in Horde Mode)

-- Ogre Magi Fireblast and Unrefined Fireblast AOE or something like that

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- Invoker forge spirit melting strike hits creeps

-- Razor Static link is AOE and effects creeps

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful

-- Venomancer Scourge Wards have a limit (like pugna ward fpr example) instead of just a death timer

20:19 - Hewdraw: add an abilityspecial value for percentage
20:19 - Hewdraw: then get the targets hp
20:19 - Hewdraw: and do target_hp * stack_amount * damage_percentage for the damage
20:19 - Hewdraw: max hp not current

Ideas:

 Map where one player plays with thE horde and can summon and control some units and has certain abilities, obviously the model would be a skeleton because meme
