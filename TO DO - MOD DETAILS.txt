MOD STUFF TO DO:
-- Fix backdoor protection on 4p hard
-- Fix sounds
-- Zombie + skeltons at 40 mins
-- Radiance not working on ancient type mobs
-- PLAYERS GET GOLD FROM DISCONNECTED PLAYERS

Bigger Jobs:

1. Add way to buy upgrades like buying back buildings (towers in the base) through a purchasable item. 
(The towers in question are currently called "npc_dota_hoard_tower" on the 4p map and "npc_dota_hoard_tower_easy" on the 5p map.

2. The bot lane friendly creep spawn stops spawning when there is a certain number of units lingering around
(Important to stop lag issues from banking them too much - It would be nice if the friendly units could be upgraded by killing rax/purchasing upgrades)
 
3. npc_dota_creature_roshan needs to be a more viable objective:
-- Roshan drops rapiers? (I'll make rapiers no longer purchasable from the shop) 
-- Following the Roshan Theme, I'll make some big mobs that hang around in spots on the map, 
I'll need help getting them to drop stuff (again rapiers or whatever, I need to refine this idea)

4. Instead of steady creep spawn top, players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn there and attack towards the dire ancient. 


KV STUFF:

//ITEMS:

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITES:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- Naga Ensnare is AOE (like earthbind)

-- Ursa fury swipes does increasing %hp based damage instead of a static damage increment

-- A rework of Dazzle's Poison Touch (Make it hit multiple targets or have aoe would be good)

-- Magnus Skewer effects creeps (I tried doing this myself, again should be easy but I failed)

-- A new ultimate for Vengeful Spirit (This can be literally anything you think would be fun/useful in Horde Mode)

-- Ogre Magi Fireblast and Unrefined Fireblast AOE or something like that

-- Beast Master Roar does AOE damage and Knockback 

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- PA Dagger does something cool, like fans out in front of her like whirling axes or something, idk.

-- Invoker forge spirit melting strike hits creeps

-- Razor Static link is AOE and effects creeps

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful

-- Venomancer Scourge Wards have a limit (like pugna ward fpr example) instead of just a death timer
