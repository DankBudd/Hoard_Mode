MOD STUFF TO DO:
-- Fix storm spirit pull too loud
-- Enigma Midnight pulse doesn't work on bosses
-- something interesting 40 minutes in
-- Radiance not working on ancient type mobs
-- PLAYERS GET GOLD FROM DISCONNECTED PLAYERS

Bigger Jobs:

1. Add way to buy upgrades like buying back buildings (towers in the base) through a purchasable item. 
(The towers in question are currently called "npc_dota_hoard_tower" on the 4p map and "npc_dota_hoard_tower_easy" on the 5p map.

2. The bot lane friendly creep spawn stops spawning when there is a certain number of units lingering around
(Important to stop lag issues from banking them too much - It would be nice if the friendly units could be upgraded by killing rax/purchasing upgrades)
 
3. npc_dota_creature_roshan needs to be a more viable objective:
-- Roshan drops rapiers? (I'll make rapiers no longer purchasable from the shop maybe) 
-- Following the Roshan Theme, I'll make some big mobs that hang around in spots on the map, 
I'll need help getting them to drop stuff (again rapiers or whatever, I need to refine this idea)

4. Instead of steady creep spawn top, players can purchase waves of creeps to spawn there and attack towards the dire ancient. 

5. Map where one player plays withteh horde and can summon and control some units and has certain abilities, obviously the model would be a skeleton because meme

KV STUFF:

//ITEMS:

-- New Consumable 7/8th slot item

//ABILITES:

-- Batrider Lasso grabs an AOE of targets

-- Ursa fury swipes does increasing %hp based damage instead of a static damage increment

-- A rework of Dazzle's Poison Touch (Make it hit multiple targets or have aoe would be good)

-- A new ultimate for Vengeful Spirit (This can be literally anything you think would be fun/useful in Horde Mode)

-- Ogre Magi Fireblast and Unrefined Fireblast AOE or something like that

-- Beast Master Roar does AOE damage and Knockback 

-- Brewmaster Ultimate spawns spirit pandas to control (like visiage familiars) Earth Panda lvl 1, Wind Panda lvl 2, Fire panda on lvl 3

-- Invoker forge spirit melting strike hits creeps

-- Razor Static link is AOE and effects creeps

-- Razor passive replaced with something more useful

-- Venomancer Scourge Wards have a limit (like pugna ward fpr example) instead of just a death timer
